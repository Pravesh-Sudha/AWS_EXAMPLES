# AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification Prep

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document and share the code for hands-on labs completed during my preparation for the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification**. As an **AWS Community Builder**, I‚Äôm excited to showcase practical experiments and configurations that deepen my understanding of AWS services. This repo serves as a resource for anyone studying for the certification or exploring AWS cloud concepts.

## üìö About the Repository

This repository contains code, scripts, and configurations for various AWS services explored during my certification prep. Each lab focuses on key AWS concepts like VPC, IAM, S3, EC2, CloudFormation, and more, with practical demos to reinforce learning. The code is organized by topic or day of study, making it easy to navigate and replicate.

## üõ†Ô∏è Labs and Topics Covered

The repo includes hands-on labs for the following AWS services and concepts (continuously updated):

- **Amazon S3**: Bucket policies, client-side encryption, CORS, static website hosting, and access points.
- **VPC**: Creating VPCs from scratch, configuring subnets, route tables, internet gateways, NAT gateways, VPC peering, and Network ACLs.
- **IAM**: AWS Managed, Customer Managed, and Inline Policies, Security Token Service (STS), and role-based access.
- **EC2**: Launching instances, configuring security groups, and using Session Manager for secure access.
- **CloudFormation**: Templates for automating resource creation (e.g., IAM users, EC2 instances, VPC configurations).
- **Networking**: Elastic IPs, Transit Gateways, AWS Direct Connect, and VPC endpoints for private AWS service access.

Each lab includes:
- Code files (e.g., JSON policies, YAML CloudFormation templates, CLI commands, or scripts).
- Brief descriptions of the lab‚Äôs purpose and steps.

- Each folder corresponds to an AWS service or lab topic.
- Subfolders contain specific labs with relevant code and documentation.
- CloudFormation templates are stored in the `cloudformation/` directory or within relevant lab folders.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use this repository:

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pravesh-Sudha/AWS_EXAMPLES.git
   cd AWS_EXAMPLES
   ```

2. **Prerequisites**:
   - An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
   - AWS CLI configured with your credentials (`aws configure`).
   - Basic knowledge of AWS services and CloudFormation.
   - Optional: Tools like Ruby or Python for specific labs (e.g., S3 encryption).

3. **Run a Lab**:
   - Navigate to the desired lab folder (e.g., `s3/bucket-policy-lab/`).
   - Follow the instructions in the lab‚Äôs README or comments within the code.
   - Use the provided CloudFormation templates, CLI commands, or scripts to deploy resources.
   - Refer to screenshots for expected outputs or console results.

4. **Clean Up**:
   - Delete resources after completing labs to avoid unexpected AWS charges.
   - Use `aws cloudformation delete-stack` for CloudFormation-deployed resources.
